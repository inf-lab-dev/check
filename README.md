# check

This repository contains the checks for use with [check50](https://github.com/cs50/check50).
Therefore, make sure that in each check-directory there is a `.cs50.yml` file with the content `check50: true`.

## Checks

The various checks are spread over multiple branches as [check50](https://github.com/cs50/check50) uses paths of the form `<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>`, and thus we can encode information in the `<branch>` part.
